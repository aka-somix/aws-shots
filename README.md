## Introduction
**AWS Shots**Â is a series of short Medium articles that aims to cover quick yet practical use cases on AWS that often do not make it into official documentation, in an attempt of helping you unlock the true potential of combining and integrating Cloud native (and often serverless) services.

## About this repo
Each folder of this repository is linked to an *"AWS Shot"* issue on Medium. You can use this code to try out in a hands-on environment the solutions proposed in the article.  
For each folder, you will find a guide on deploying, testing and destroying the AWS Architecture.
